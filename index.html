            <h2>Welcome to My Personal Website!</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Chengxun Ren, Frank. I have a deep-rooted passion for 
            the intricate worlds of mathematics, computer science, and statistics. The elegance of 
            mathematical proofs, the creativity of coding, and the power of data analysis continually 
            inspire me. I find immense satisfaction in unraveling complex problems and transforming 
            data into actionable insights. <br> <br>
            When I'm not immersed in the world of numbers and code, I find rejuvenation in a 
            diverse range of activities. Traveling to new places, exploring different cultures, 
            and experiencing new adventures is a constant source of inspiration. Physical activities 
            like working out, running, tennis, and basketball help me maintain a healthy balance 
            and clear my mind. Music and anime is another passion of mine, allowing me to relax and connect 
            with different emotions. These hobbies provide essential counterbalance to 
            my intellectual pursuits, allowing me to recharge and return to my work with renewed 
            energy and creativity. <br> <br>
            This website showcases my academic background, professional experiences, projects, and achievements. 
            Please explore to learn more about me and my work. (●ˇ∀ˇ●)</p>

                to create a streamlined data processing workflow.</li>
            <li>Analyzed <strong>14 research directions</strong> based on raw data focusing on traffic flow, 
                highway tolls, congestion patterns, accident trends, and vehicle composition.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a <strong>comprehensive toll evasion detection system</strong> that integrated both 
                        <strong>supervised and unsupervised machine learning models</strong> to identify 3 kinds of 
                        toll evasion behaviors based on ETC, MTC, and surveillance data.</li>
                    <li>Designed a <strong>decision tree model</strong> that achieved <strong>90.5% accuracy</strong> 
                        in identifying fake toll-free logistics vehicles. Leveraged Borderline-SMOTE and ChiMerge algorithms 
                        for data preprocessing, followed by constructing the model using the CART algorithm 
                        and Gini coefficient.</li>
                    <li>Implemented <strong>Gaussian Mixture Model</strong> with the Expectation-Maximization
                         algorithm to estimate reasonable load intervals for each vehicle type and driving cycle. 
                        Identified toll evasion vehicles by detecting outliers, with iterative improvements based 
                        on feedback from detected cases.</li>
                    <li>The project was <strong>accepted</strong> by <strong>Jiangsu Ninghang Expressway Co., LTD</strong> and

                    <li>Trained the model using the 15-min interval historical traffic flow data collected 
                        from highway gantries within a 100-kilometer radius of the toll station, 
                        achieving <strong>78% accuracy</strong> and <strong>14% Mean Absolute Percentage 
                            Error</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Designed a <strong>toll station traffic peak warning system</strong> based on the models
                         to enhance traffic management and reduce congestion.</li>
